Plac: Parsing the Command Line the Easy Way
-------------------------------------------

``plac`` is a Python package that can generate command line parameters from function signatures.

``plac`` works on versions of Python from 2.6 through 3.X.

``plac`` has no dependencies beyond modules already present in the Python standard library.

Quickstart
----------

Here is how to turn a script that does some processing on a database table into a full, command-line enabled program:

.. code-block:: python

   # updatedb.py
   from datetime import datetime

   def main(dsn, table='product', today=datetime.today()):
       "Do something on the database"
       print(dsn, table, today)

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       import plac;
       plac.call(main)

Here is the help message automatically generated by plac::

  $ python updatedb.py -h
  usage: updatedb.py [-h] dsn [table] [today]

  Do something on the database

  positional arguments:
    dsn
    table       [product]
    today       [2019-07-28 07:18:20.054708]

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help  show this help message and exit

Advanced features
-----------------

Sometimes we need more control over how parameters are handled. ``plac`` offers simple decorator helpers for positional, option and flag type parameters:

.. include:: doc/example_all.py
   :literal:


Running the script with ``$ python example_all.py -h`` will give you
the following help message:

.. include:: doc/example_all.help
   :literal:

Nevertheless to say, plac can do a lot more, up to the creation of
domain-specific languages(!). See the full documentation for more details.

Notably, the main functionality of ``plac`` is implemented in a single module called ``plac_core.py`` that, if necessary, may be included and distributed with your source code thus reducing external dependencies in your code.

Documentation
--------------

* https://plac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Installation
-------------

If you wish to install the package do

::

 $ pip install plac

If you prefer to install the full distribution from source, including
the documentation, download the tarball_, unpack it and run

::

 $ python setup.py install

.. _tarball: https://pypi.org/project/plac/#files


Testing
--------

Run

::

 $ python doc/test_plac.py

You will see several apparent errors, but this is right, since the tests
are checking for several error conditions. The important thing is that
you get at the a line like

``Executed XX tests OK``
